# Cycles Shader Exporter

This is an addon for Blender that allows users to export Cycles shaders in a format compatible with my [Cycles for Max](https://cyclesformax.net) plugin.

Currently supports Blender versions 2.80 and 2.81

## Usage

First, select an object with a shader that you would like to export. With that object selected, choose `File > Export > Cycles for Max Shader (.shader)`

## To Install

Drop `io_cyclesmax_shader.py` into `Blender/[version]/scripts/addons/`. With the file in place, start Blender and navigate to the "Add-ons" section of the Blender Preferences window to enable this addon.
